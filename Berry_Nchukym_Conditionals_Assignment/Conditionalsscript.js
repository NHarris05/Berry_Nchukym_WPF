//Conditionals assignment.... Growing carrots and onions


var growCarrot = prompt("How Many Carrot Seeds Did You Plant?"); // The first prompt will have the user input the amount of carrot seeds they planted this spring
var growOnion = prompt ("How Many Onion Seeds Did You Plant?"); // This prompt will ask for the amount of onion seed the user planted this spring
  console.log(Number(growCarrot) + Number(growOnion)); //The result will print in the console as a casted number. Because the numbers for each were 50 and 50, the result without casting would have been 5050 as the amount of seeds total planted
