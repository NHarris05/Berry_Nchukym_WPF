//Movie ticket Price//

var discountAge = 55; //set the discount age to 55
var age = 50; //this is a test age to compare
var price = 7; // price of the discounted ticket
var time = 3; //time that a person would go to the movies

(discountAge = time ) ? console.log("Your Ticket Price Is $7") :console.log("You Have To Pay Full Price");

// using the ternary method to create one line of code. So if the discount age is equal to the time the ticket price will be reduced
//otherwise, they will have to pay full price
